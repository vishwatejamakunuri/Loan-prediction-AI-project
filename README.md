# Loan Prediction AI Project 🏦🤖

This project is an **AI-based Loan Prediction and Credit Risk Assessment System** that uses machine learning models to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default or be approved. It leverages customer demographic and financial data to assist banks or financial institutions in making informed, data-driven lending decisions.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Loan default prediction is critical for financial institutions to reduce credit risk and ensure long-term sustainability. Traditional loan processing is time-consuming and often subjective. This project aims to automate the loan approval process using a machine learning model trained on historical loan applicant data.

## ✅ Features
- Data preprocessing and handling of missing values.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights.
- Model training using classification algorithms.
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Prediction interface via notebook.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Applicant Income
- Credit History
- Loan Amount
- Employment Status
- Gender, Marital Status, etc.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
